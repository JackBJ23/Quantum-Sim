# Quantum-Sim: Quantum-Inspired Physics Simulators

The `quantumsim` library, developed by Jack B. Jedlicki as part of the Physics Bachelor's Thesis "Tensor Networks for Quantum-Inspired Simulations", provides a set of functions for running quantum-inspired simulations with the one-dimensional diffusion equation. It builds upon previous work on tensor networks by Garcia et al. [2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09430), and provides new algorithms for efficient implementation in large grids, new operators for the case of the diffusion equation, new operators based on higher-order approximations, and implementations in limits where classical methods fail with conventional approaches. It also includes tools for visualization. 

To install the `quantumsim` library:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/JackBJ23/Quantum-Sim.git
```

To clone the repository with experiments:

```
!git clone https://github.com/JackBJ23/Quantum-Sim.git
%cd Quantum-Sim
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
