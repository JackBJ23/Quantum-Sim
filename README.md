# Quantum-Sim: Quantum-Inspired Physics Simulators

The `quantumsim` library, developed as part of the Physics Bachelor's Thesis "Tensor Networks for Quantum-Inspired Simulations", provides a set of functions for running simulations with the one-dimensional diffusion equation. It builds upon previous work on tensor networks and quantum-inspired techniques by Garcia et al. (2021), and provides new algorithms for efficient implementation in large grids, new operators in the case of the diffusion equation, new operators based on higher-order approximations, and implementations in limits where classical methods fail with conventional approaches. It also includes new tools for visualization. 

To install the `quantumsim` library:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/JackBJ23/Quantum-Sim.git
```

To clone the repository with experiments:

```
!git clone https://github.com/JackBJ23/Quantum-Sim.git
%cd Quantum-Sim
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
